I did not check the your github page thoroughly at first for the requirement of building this Susoku Solver program. So I write my own program from scratch, from my own understanding of how the program should be built, with the help from the website: https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm (which was provided in your gihub page)

Before I realized that I am only required to write 3 functions to build up on an existing program written by you in advance, it was already too late for me, because I was only 5 days away from the exam week.

I hope you would understand my circumstances, and spend some time take a look at my code.

***NOTE: Please CLONE and RUN this on VISUAL STUDIO, I do not know if it works on VISUAL STUDIO CODE.

To RUN and perform TEST CASES, go to the 'main.c' file for instructions
